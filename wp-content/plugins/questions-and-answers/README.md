Accessible AJAX Comments

This is a plug-in derived from the Accessible AJAX comments library built for the WordPress Theme Accessibility Pattern Library (https://github.com/wpaccessibility/a11ythemepatterns/tree/master/comment-form-with-js-aria)

Please make pull requests or raise issues in the WP Accessibility pattern library, unless the issues are specific to the plug-in implementation.
