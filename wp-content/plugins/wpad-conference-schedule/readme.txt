== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What kind of events is this plugin good for? =

This plugin is intended for both multi-track and single-track events that would like to display their event schedule in an easy to read, tabular format. It can be used by conferences, trade shows, conventions, festivals, company retreats, online events, and even wedding weekends...anything you want!

= Is the schedule mobile responsive? =

Yes, the schedule is mobile responsive. At smaller device sizes, the table will break into individual blocks for each timeframe in your schedule. Please see screenshots for an example.

= Does this plugin have a Gutenberg block? What if I'm using the Classic Editor plugin? =

This plugin was built as a "Gutenberg-first" plugin and includes a block with configurable options. This makes it super easy to add a conference (or other event) schedule to any page or post on your website.

If you're not yet using Gutenberg or need to add your schedule to a widget area or page builder controlled page, you can use our shortcode. [Learn More About the Shortcode](https://wpconferenceschedule.com/documentation/shortcode-free-version/)

= What is the shortcode? What options does it include? =

The base shortcode to display your schedule without using the included Gutenberg block is [schedule]. For full documentation and available shortcode attributes/options please [visit our shortcode documentation](https://wpconferenceschedule.com/documentation/shortcode-free-version/).

= Can I add custom colors/font sizes to the schedule? =

Our free version includes coloring for both a light and dark schedule, as shown in the plugin [demo](https://wpconferenceschedule.com/#demo). You can easily toggle between these two color modes with both our Gutenberg block and shortcode.

We have included lots of helper classes in the schedule in rows and individual sessions, which will allow you to recolor the schedule as desired via CSS in your theme or the WordPress customizer. If you need help recoloring the schedule or adjusting font sizes, you can [submit a customization request here](https://wpconferenceschedule.com/request-customization/).

Custom color pickers and font controls on a per-session or per-track basis are planned for a future pro version of the plugin. [Learn More About Pro](https://wpconferenceschedule.com/pro)

= Is this multi-site compatible? =

Yes! This plugin is built with multi-site in mind and is/has been tested in a multi-site environment.
